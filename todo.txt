1. Display instructions and cycle through screens (Done)
2. Display stimuli and context
    2a. Display stimuli in specific locations
    2b. Display random stimuli from images folder
    2c. Randomly choose 80/20 congruency block or 80/20 incongruency block
    2d. Randomly make the stimuli congruent or incongruent (according to the block)
        I. Store if a stimuli is larger or smaller than a basketball as a 1 or -1
        II. Congruency can be 1 and incongruency is -1, then multiply congruency value with stimuli size value. If stimuli value stays the same, then it's congruent trial. Otherwise, it's incongruent.
        III. Display corresponding flankers for the congruency value (if congruent AND larger, display smaller flankers. If congruent and smaller, display larger flankers).
    2e. Randomly assign a context to a block and display it for each trial in that block
3. Allow button presses
    3a. Button presses cycle to the next screens
4. Store data
    4a. Store participant ID as an object of a class
        I. Store reaction time for each trial under the participant object
        II. Store button press value
        III. Store congruency value
        IV. Store stimuli size
        V. Store if button press value matches with size value
        VI. Store stimuli value
        VII. Store context value
        VIII. Store instruction screen timing
5. Display repeat stimuli in testing phase (with same congruency and context)
